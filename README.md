## Overview
This project automates the Nebraska Department of Transportation (NDOT) concrete mix design workflow by translating the logic contained in the NDOT Mix Design Excel worksheet into a modular Python-based application.
The original Excel tool performs volume-based mix design calculations for one cubic yard of concrete. While accurate, the spreadsheet relies on manual data entry and embedded formulas that are not easily scalable or transparent. The purpose of this project is to:
replicate all engineering calculations in Python,
implement sequential user input prompts,
generate a formatted 1-cubic-yard weight chart,
evaluate four realistic concrete mix scenarios, and
improve transparency, repeatability, and reliability of the workflow.
The automated model mirrors the Excel logic while improving structure, modularity, and documentation.
